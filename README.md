### 2. Proposal
We have proposed a simple but fun to play game which will test the reflexes of the user.
1. There are 4 LEDs in total and 3 Pushbuttons.
2. One Led will be an indicator LED while the other 3 LEDs will be part of the game visualizer.
3. Each of the visulaizer LED will have one push button associated with it.
4. The LEDs will sequentially light up at a high speed forming a pattern.
5. When the Indicator LED glows, the user is supposed to press the push button that corresponds to the visualizer LED which was lit when the indicator LED lit up.
6. If the user is succesfull he wins the game and all the LEDS will blink simultaneously indicating a win else nothing will happen indicating a loss.

This will be a cool game used to test the agili


ty of a person.

### 3. Components needed
1. 3 Push Buttons
2. 4 LEDs
3. 4 330 ohms resistors for the LEDs
4. 3 10 kilo-ohms resistors acting as pull up resitors for the push button.
5.  Protoboard
6.  Breadboard and Jumper Wires
